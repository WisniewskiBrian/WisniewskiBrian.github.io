            <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
            <p>The primary purposes of this report are to fit a classification tree model with the goal of predicting a death event based on other variables and to create a questionnaire, based on those findings, that doctors could use to assess a patient’s risk. This was accomplished by first selecting variables that appeared to correlate with death events and then fitting the tree model using those variables. To determine the variables through correlation assessment, various plots (Figure 1 & Figure 2) were created to gain a preliminary understanding of their correlation with death events. Based on my interpretation of those plots and the lack of correlation associated with them, I chose to exclude the platelets and time variables.</p>
            <p><strong>Technical Methods and Skills Used:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Variable Selection:</strong> Selected variables that appeared to correlate with death events through initial correlation assessment using various plots.</li>
                <li><strong>Model Fitting:</strong> Fitted and plotted the classification tree model using the selected variables.</li>
                <li><strong>Comparative Analysis:</strong> Created additional plots for models without certain variables to assess their performance relative to the original model.</li>
                <li><strong>Questionnaire Development:</strong> Developed a questionnaire based on the structure and logic of the most informative and easily interpretable tree model.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong></p>
            <p>The final tree model provided the most informative yet easily interpretable results, which were used as the basis for the questionnaire. The questionnaire is structured as follows, guided by the logic presented in the tree model:</p>
            <h3>Questionnaire</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>What is the patient’s serum creatinine level (mg/dL)?</li>
                <li>What is the patient’s ejection fraction percentage?</li>
                <li>What is the age of the patient (years)?</li>
                <li>What is the patient’s serum sodium (mEq/L)?</li>
                <li>What is the patient’s creatinine phosphokinase (mcg/L)?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In summary, the model and questionnaire provided a structured method to assess a patient’s risk of a death event based on key medical variables, offering a valuable tool for healthcare providers.</p>
