        <h1>Using Customer Data to Optimize Incentive Deployment and Reduce Cancellations at Buckeye Resorts</h1>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
            <p>This project aimed to reduce the financial losses incurred by Buckeye Resorts, Inc. (BRI) due to reservation cancellations. By leveraging customer data, the objective was to predict the likelihood of a reservation being canceled and improve the effectiveness of incentive programs designed to prevent such cancellations.</p>
            <p><strong>Technical Methods and Skills Used:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Collection and Preprocessing:</strong> Analyzed a dataset containing 119,391 customer reservations over three years (2015-2017), including 32 attributes for each reservation. Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the data and identify relevant features for modeling.</li>
                <li><strong>Feature Selection:</strong> Chose key customer attributes for the predictive model:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Predictor Variable:</strong> <em>is_canceled:</em> Indicator of whether a customer reservation was canceled.</li>
                        <li><strong>Explanatory Variables:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><em>kidsToAdults:</em> Ratio of the number of kids to adults.</li>
                                <li><em>cancelRate:</em> (previous_bookings_not_canceled - previous_bookings_canceled) / total number of bookings.</li>
                                <li><em>correctRoom:</em> Logical indicator where reserved_room_type equals assigned_room_type.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Model Development:</strong> Developed a cost matrix to evaluate the benefits of different predictive models. Implemented a k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) model to predict reservation cancellations, focusing on achieving high accuracy at low cost.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Model Results:</strong> The KNN model demonstrated high accuracy in predicting cancellations using the selected variables, offering a cost-effective solution for BRI. The model's confusion matrix indicated a strong predictive performance, justifying the approach.</li>
                <li><strong>Recommendations and Discussion:</strong> Recommended that BRI proceed with the proposed data-driven approach to predict and mitigate reservation cancellations. Suggested conducting trials with varying incentive amounts ($50, $100, $150) over a year to determine the most profitable incentive amount, as current data was insufficient to conclusively establish the optimal compensation.</li>
                <li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Successfully constructed a predictive model using <em>is_canceled</em> as the predictor variable and <em>kidsToAdults, cancelRate,</em> and <em>correctRoom</em> as explanatory variables. Confirmed that implementing some form of compensation can benefit reservation follow-through. Proposed further trials with different incentive amounts to refine the approach and maximize profit from reservations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Interactive Features:</strong> Implemented interactive visualizations and dashboards to allow BRI to monitor model predictions and adjust incentive strategies in real-time.</p>
            <p><strong>Feedback and Iteration:</strong> Gathered feedback from stakeholders and iteratively improved the model and incentive strategy based on real-world performance and user input.</p>
