            <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
            <p>An airline wants to identify some opportunities to improve customer satisfaction and to identify the most dissatisfied customers to target for coupons. This report intends to address those wants by examining the airlines data set, which contains variables related to customer satisfaction and flights. Plots, context, and the use of random forest modeling are used and takeaways compiled in this report.</p>
            <p><strong>Technical Methods and Skills Used:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Exploration:</strong> Explored the dataset using various visualization techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and bar charts to understand the distribution and relationship of variables with customer satisfaction.</li>
                <li><strong>Random Forest Modeling:</strong> Employed random forest modeling to analyze the importance of different variables in predicting customer satisfaction and identifying dissatisfied customers.</li>
                <li><strong>Statistical Analysis:</strong> Utilized statistical methods to evaluate variable importance, mean decrease Gini, and predict customer satisfaction based on key variables.</li>
                <li><strong>Experimental Design:</strong> Designed experiments to offer coupons to specific customer segments based on model predictions and analyzed the impact of these interventions on customer satisfaction.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong></p>
            <p>The analysis identified key variables such as age, ease of online booking, cleanliness, and baggage handling as significant predictors of customer satisfaction. Recommendations were provided for improving customer satisfaction through targeted interventions such as seat upgrades, online experience enhancements, and staff training. The project highlighted the importance of data-driven decision-making and collaboration between financial analysts and airline specialists to implement effective strategies for improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.</p>
