        <h1>Redesigning OSU's IDP Calculator with DataSense test</h1>
        <div class="description">
            <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
            <p>The Integrated Data Protection (IDP) project involved redesigning Ohio State University's IDP Calculator to improve its usability and user experience. The goal was to create a tool that helps researchers and university staff understand and comply with data protection policies by providing a more intuitive and informative interface.</p>
            <p><strong>Technical Methods and Skills Used:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>User Research and Analysis:</strong> Conducted user research to gather insights on current user experiences, pain points, and needs. This involved surveys, interviews, and usability testing.</li>
                <li><strong>UI/UX Design:</strong> Applied user-centered design principles to create wireframes, mockups, and prototypes of the new IDP Calculator interface.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Categorization and Mapping:</strong> Simplified data categorization and mapping processes to make it easier for users to understand and apply data protection requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Interactive Features:</strong> Implemented interactive features such as tooltips, help icons, and customizable views to enhance user engagement and understanding.</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback and Iteration:</strong> Collected feedback from user testing sessions and iteratively improved the design based on user input.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Outcome:</strong></p>
            <p>The redesigned IDP Calculator, named DataSense, was well-received by users during testing. Key improvements included a more intuitive interface, better data categorization, and enhanced interactive features. Users appreciated the clear and informative layout, which made it easier to navigate and understand data protection requirements. Recommendations for further improvements included adding labels to icons, refining the autocomplete feature, and providing pop-up text hints for key elements.</p>
